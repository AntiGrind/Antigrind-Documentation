# Faith.WriteMemory

### Faith.WriteMemory
Writes the value to the memory address provided, it'll automatically detect the type, whether it's float int or bool (sdding more types soon), so you don't have to worry about that when writing.

```jsx title="WriteMemory Example"
-- Address is the memory address, you should know what this means if you are using this API.
-- value is the value
Faith.WriteMemory(address, value)
```
