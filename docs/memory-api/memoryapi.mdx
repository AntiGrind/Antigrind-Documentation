# Memory Editing API (BETA)

You can edit the game's memory using these, also read it. However you must know what you are doing even more than with globals.
To be able to efficiently use this you must have some reverse engineering knowledge (or you can steal offsets from unknowncheats.net like cherax).

:::danger Careful!
There's no error checking or anything when doing this, if you fuck up you will probably crash.
If you don't fuck up but don't know what you are doing you can potentially ban yourself if you touch what you shouldn't.

## Functions

Quite simple, you have a function to write globals, and three functions to read globals (one for each type, float, int or bool).
