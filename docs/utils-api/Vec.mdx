# vec

### vec
Overloads vector2, vector3 and vector4 into a single function. Automatically counts the amount of arguments you pass it and either returns a vector2,3,4 depending on how many you passed.

```jsx title="vec Example"
-- ... in this case are float values and you must pass anything between 2 values and 4 values. No more no less.

myVector4 = vec(x,y,z,w) --Vector4
myVector3 = vec(x,y,z) --Vector3
myVector2 = vec(x,y) --Vector2
```
