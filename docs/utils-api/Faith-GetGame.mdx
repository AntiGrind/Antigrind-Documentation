# Faith.GetGame

### Faith.GetGame
Returns a string of what game the API is running on. In our case it'll always be "Grand Theft Auto V".
You can use it if you want to code multiplatform for the Faith API as it's a generic Lua Environment for games.

```jsx title="Faith.GetGame Example"

print(Faith.GetGame()) --"Grand Theft Auto V"
```
