# sprint

### sprint
Works the same as print but instead of outputting to log it returns the string, useful if you want to turn numbers and stuff into a string. And for formatting.

```jsx title="sprint Example"
-- ... means an unlimited amount of arguments and in this case all types should be supported.

something = sprint(...)
```
