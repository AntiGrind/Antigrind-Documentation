# GTA.MarkAsModder

### GTA.MarkAsModder
If you want to make your own modder detections use this, this marks the player as modder in the menu and broadcasts a OnModderDetection event.
Try using this only if you are sure, avoid false positives.

```jsx title="MarkAsModder Example"
-- handle is the player handle as always.
-- reason is a string containing the reason why you marked this person as a modder.

GTA.MarkAsModder(handle, reason)
```
