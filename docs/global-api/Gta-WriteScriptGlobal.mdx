# GTA.WriteScriptGlobal

### GTA.WriteScriptGlobal
Writes the value to your global var of choice, it'll automatically detect the type, whether it's float int or bool, so you don't have to worry about that when writing.

```jsx title="WriteScriptGlobal Example"
-- globalIndex is the global variable index that you want to write to. This can be found in the GTA scripts.
-- value is the value
GTA.WriteScriptGlobal(globalIndex, value)
```
