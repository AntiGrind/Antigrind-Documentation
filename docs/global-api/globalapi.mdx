# Script Globals API

The GTA Scripts use globals to store information and communicate across each other, manipulating these globals can net very interesting results. 
Therefore we expose this API to our Lua Developers so they can go beyond what you can do with just natives.

## Functions

Quite simple, you have a function to write globals, and three functions to read globals (one for each type, float, int or bool).
