# Autorun
The lua executor will execute any file called "autorun.lua" at Documents/AntiGrind/Scripts

Be sure to check game status on your autorun.lua as the end user may inject the menu anytime.
(For example if you want to run an online-only thing you should perhaps check they are in a proper online session and not on singleplayer).
