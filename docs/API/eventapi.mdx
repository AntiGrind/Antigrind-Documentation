# Event API

Our Lua Executor has an Event system that is used to communicate between the menu and lua, it can also be used to communicate across lua scripts.

## Functions

The event API consists of two functions, Faith.RegisterEvent (for registering event listeners) and Faith.FireEvent (to fire, or execute the events).


## Built-In events.

The menu comes with Built-In events that will be fired when certain conditions are met, a new player joining, a player being detected as a cheater etc...

:::tip Performance Tip
Using events will usually net a performance benefit instead of iterating over say a player list.
Events callbacks will also automatically be called on the right thread, so you don't have to worry about that!
:::

### Faith.RegisterEvent
Registers an event listener, that will be called when said event is fired. For built-in events check below.

```jsx title="RegisterEvent Example"
Faith.RegisterEvent("OnModderDetection", function(playerHandle, playerName, reason)

if GTA.IsModder(playerHandle) then
print(playerName, " is a modder because ", reason).
end
```

### Faith.FireEvent
Manually fires an event with the given arguments.

```jsx title="FireEvent and Custom Events Example"
Faith.FireEvent("Hello World", 69, true, "goodbye")

Faith.RegisterEvent("Hello World", function(a,b,c)
print(a,b) --prints "69truegoodbye"
end)

```
