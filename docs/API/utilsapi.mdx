# Utility API

These are functions that will come in handy when coding.

### GTA.IsFriend
Returns whether the player is Host, or not.

```jsx title="IsFriend Example"
-- handle is the player handle as always.
print(GTA.IsFriend(Handle))) --"true"
```

### GTA.IsHost
Returns whether the player is Host, or not.

```jsx title="IsHost Example"
print(GTA.IsHost())) --"true"
```

### GTA.IsModder
Returns whether the player is a modder, or not.

```jsx title="IsModder Example"
-- handle is the player handle as always.

print(GTA.IsModder(handle)) --"true"
```

### GTA.MarkAsModder
If you want to make your own modder detections use this, this marks the player as modder in the menu and broadcasts a OnModderDetection event.
Try using this only if you are sure, avoid false positives.

```jsx title="MarkAsModder Example"
-- handle is the player handle as always.
-- reason is a string containing the reason why you marked this person as a modder.

GTA.MarkAsModder(handle, reason)
```

### Faith.GetGame
Returns a string of what game the API is running on. In our case it'll always be "Grand Theft Auto V".
You can use it if you want to code multiplatform for the Faith API as it's a generic Lua Environment for games.

```jsx title="Faith.GetGame Example"

print(Faith.GetGame()) --"Grand Theft Auto V"
```

### Faith.GetTime
Returns the current times.

```jsx title="Faith.GetTime Example"

print(Faith.GetTime()) --Some numbers lmao
```

### print
Prints what you provide on the log, it's able to print almost any type of variable and supports an unlimited amount of arguments.

```jsx title="print Example"
-- ... means an unlimited amount of arguments and in this case all types should be supported.

print(...)
```

### sprint
Works the same as print but instead of outputting to log it returns the string, useful if you want to turn numbers and stuff into a string. And for formatting.

```jsx title="sprint Example"
-- ... means an unlimited amount of arguments and in this case all types should be supported.

something = sprint(...)
```

### vector2
Vector2 constructor.

```jsx title="vector2 Example"
-- x and y are floats.

myVector = vector2(x,y)
```

### vector3
Vector3 constructor, you might need it for natives.

```jsx title="vector3 Example"
-- x,y and z are floats.

myVector = vector3(x,y,z)
```

### vector4
Vector4 constructor.

```jsx title="vector3 Example"
-- x,y,z and w are floats.

myVector = vector4(x,y,z,w)
```

### vec
Overloads vector2, vector3 and vector4 into a single function. Automatically counts the amount of arguments you pass it and either returns a vector2,3,4 depending on how many you passed.

```jsx title="vec Example"
-- ... in this case are float values and you must pass anything between 2 values and 4 values. No more no less.

myVector4 = vec(x,y,z,w) --Vector4
myVector3 = vec(x,y,z) --Vector3
myVector2 = vec(x,y) --Vector2
```
