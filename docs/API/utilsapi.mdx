```

### Faith.GetTime
Returns the current times.

```jsx title="Faith.GetTime Example"

Prints what you provide on the log, it's able to print almost any type of variable and supports an unlimited amount of arguments.

```jsx title="print Example"
-- ... means an unlimited amount of arguments and in this case all types should be supported.

print(...)
```

### sprint
Works the same as print but instead of outputting to log it returns the string, useful if you want to turn numbers and stuff into a string. And for formatting.

```jsx title="sprint Example"
-- ... means an unlimited amount of arguments and in this case all types should be supported.

something = sprint(...)
```

### vector2
Vector2 constructor.

```jsx title="vector2 Example"
-- x and y are floats.

myVector = vector2(x,y)
```

### vector3
Vector3 constructor, you might need it for natives.

```jsx title="vector3 Example"
-- x,y and z are floats.

myVector = vector3(x,y,z)
```

### vector4
Vector4 constructor.

```jsx title="vector3 Example"
-- x,y,z and w are floats.

myVector = vector4(x,y,z,w)
```

### vec
Overloads vector2, vector3 and vector4 into a single function. Automatically counts the amount of arguments you pass it and either returns a vector2,3,4 depending on how many you passed.

```jsx title="vec Example"
-- ... in this case are float values and you must pass anything between 2 values and 4 values. No more no less.

myVector4 = vec(x,y,z,w) --Vector4
myVector3 = vec(x,y,z) --Vector3
myVector2 = vec(x,y) --Vector2
```
