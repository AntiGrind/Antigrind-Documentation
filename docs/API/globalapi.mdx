# Script Globals API

The GTA Scripts use globals to store information and communicate across each other, manipulating these globals can net very interesting results. 
Therefore we expose this API to our Lua Developers so they can go beyond what you can do with just natives.

## Functions

Quite simple, you have a function to write globals, and three functions to read globals (one for each type, float, int or bool).

### GTA.WriteScriptGlobal
Writes the value to your global var of choice, it'll automatically detect the type, whether it's float int or bool, so you don't have to worry about that when writing.

```jsx title="WriteScriptGlobal Example"
-- globalIndex is the global variable index that you want to write to. This can be found in the GTA scripts.
-- value is the value
GTA.WriteScriptGlobal(globalIndex, value)
```

### GTA.ReadScriptGlobalInt
Reads and returns the value of the global provided and assumes it's an integer.

```jsx title="ReadScriptGlobalInt Example"
-- globalIndex is the global variable index that you want to read from. This can be found in the GTA scripts.

print(GTA.ReadScriptGlobalInt(globalIndex))
```

### GTA.ReadScriptGlobalFloat
Reads and returns the value of the global provided and assumes it's an float.

```jsx title="ReadScriptGlobalFloat Example"
-- globalIndex is the global variable index that you want to read from. This can be found in the GTA scripts.

print(GTA.ReadScriptGlobalFloat(globalIndex))

```

### GTA.ReadScriptGlobalBool
Reads and returns the value of the global provided and assumes it's a boolean.

```jsx title="ReadScriptGlobalBool Example"
-- globalIndex is the global variable index that you want to read from. This can be found in the GTA scripts.

print(GTA.ReadScriptGlobalBool(globalIndex))

```
