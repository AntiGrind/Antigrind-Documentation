# Memory Editing API (BETA)

You can edit the game's memory using these, also read it. However you must know what you are doing even more than with globals.
To be able to efficiently use this you must have some reverse engineering knowledge (or you can steal offsets from unknowncheats.net like cherax).

:::danger Careful!
There's no error checking or anything when doing this, if you fuck up you will probably crash.
If you don't fuck up but don't know what you are doing you can potentially ban yourself if you touch what you shouldn't.

## Functions

Quite simple, you have a function to write globals, and three functions to read globals (one for each type, float, int or bool).

### Faith.GetBaseAddress
Returns the base address of the process.

```jsx title="GetBaseAddress Example"
print(Faith.GetBaseAddress())
```

### Faith.WriteMemory
Writes the value to the memory address provided, it'll automatically detect the type, whether it's float int or bool (sdding more types soon), so you don't have to worry about that when writing.

```jsx title="WriteMemory Example"
-- Address is the memory address, you should know what this means if you are using this API.
-- value is the value
Faith.WriteMemory(address, value)
```

### Faith.ReadMemoryInt
Reads and returns the value at the memory address provided.

```jsx title="ReadMemoryInt Example"
-- Address is the memory address, you should know what this means if you are using this API.

print(Faith.ReadMemoryInt(address))
```

### Faith.ReadMemoryFloat
Reads and returns the value at the memory address provided.

```jsx title="ReadMemoryFloat Example"
-- Address is the memory address, you should know what this means if you are using this API.

print(Faith.ReadMemoryFloat(address))
```

### Faith.ReadMemoryBool
Reads and returns the value at the memory address provided.

```jsx title="ReadMemoryBool Example"
-- Address is the memory address, you should know what this means if you are using this API.

print(Faith.ReadMemoryBool(address))
```
