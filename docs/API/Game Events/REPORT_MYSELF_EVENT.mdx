# REPORT_MYSELF_EVENT

This event is called when the player fails some anticheat checks. It's not too common but it is more common than the money one.

Do not bother blocking anticheat events, unless ur literally alone with them in a session.

```jsx title="Parameters"
-- Player handle / The player's handle.

```
