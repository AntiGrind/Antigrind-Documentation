# REPORT_CASH_SPAWN_EVENT

This is the best event in the game (there's other anticheat-related ones but this is the best one). If this gets called their menu is fucking trash, or they are using a shit coded lua.
This event is called when a player is spawning cash.

Do not bother blocking anticheat events, unless ur literally alone with them in a session.

```jsx title="Parameters"
-- Player handle / The player's handle.
-- int amount / The amount of $$.

```
