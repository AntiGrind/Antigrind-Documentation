# Introduction

RAGE natives are a very powerful tool, make sure to use common sense before using them. If you are not sure if something is safe please put them inside a risky section or something, do not expose your users to unexpected risks such as literally sending the server a "hey ban me!" message. Read and Test everything!

 

Most RAGE native functions have been reversed by various members of the gta community, however most of that research has been done for singleplayer so always be careful and use common sense. You may check the following link for further reference.

[GTAV NATIVE DB (dev-c.com) (NOTE: NativeDB uses a slightly different naming scheme from ours, however it's still similar so it's also useful)](http://www.dev-c.com/nativedb/)
