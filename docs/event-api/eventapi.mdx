# Event API

Our Lua Executor has an Event system that is used to communicate between the menu and lua, it can also be used to communicate across lua scripts.

## Functions

The event API consists of two functions, Faith.RegisterEvent (for registering event listeners) and Faith.FireEvent (to fire, or execute the events).


## Built-In events.

The menu comes with Built-In events that will be fired when certain conditions are met, a new player joining, a player being detected as a cheater etc...

:::tip Performance Tip
Using events will usually net a performance benefit instead of iterating over say a player list.
Events callbacks will also automatically be called on the right thread, so you don't have to worry about that!
