# Citizen.CreateThread

### Citizen.CreateThread
Creates and runs a new thread, used to run code asynchronously. MAKE SURE TO AT LEAST HAVE A Citizen.Wait INSIDE IT OR YOU WILL PROBABLY FREEZE THE GAME.

```jsx title="CreateThread Example"
-- fn is the function that will be called in the thread

Citizen.CreateThread(fn)
```
