# Citizen API Introduction

The citizen API is a compability layer with the Citizen Lua API (FiveM scripts).

:::danger Not everything is supported
This is currently in beta and not everything is supported (namely some natives have slightly different names etc...) So you can't paste some FiveM scripts.

We don't and we will never support NUI, implementing NUI would make the menu bloated and be a fucking pain in the ass to develop. You don't need a chromium browser to make a menu come on.
:::

## Threads
Citizen-style threads, they do have some advantages over Faith workers such as being able to yield them mid-function, Faith workers on the other hand are more lightweight so if you are developing for Faith consider using workers for a little more performance.

## Regarding Natives
Most natives will have the same definition as the FiveM ones, same name params...
However some will be different so you might have to fix niche natives.

The API also doesn't support CFX  namespace natives as we are on gta5 and not FiveM.
