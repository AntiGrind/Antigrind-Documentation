# Faith.PauseWorker

### Faith.PauseWorker
Pauses the worker for a set time, in miliseconds.
:::tip Tip
When you call PauseWorker the worker will be stopped on next execution and not mid-execution. Meaning that it'll execute until the end and won't keep looping until the time's done.
If you want to pause mid-call we recommend you use Citizen.CreateThread
:::

```jsx title="sprint Example"
-- ... name is the name of the worker.
-- time the time you want to pause it, in miliseconds

local called = false

Faith.CreateWorker(function() 
    if called then
        print("here we go again, 5 seconds later")
    end
    
    print("i got called")
    
    Faith.PauseWorker(5000) --Will pause the worker for 5 seconds
    
    print("i also get called because pauseworker does not take effect until it's fully executed)
    called = true  
end)
```
